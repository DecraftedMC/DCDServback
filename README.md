## Repository Info
DCDServback or in other words, Decrafted Server Backpacks is an updated fork of Servback by Octal-makes-code for 1.19 which adds server-sided backpacks, intended to be used for vanilla servers or servers utilizing PolyMC. 

**Assets are ARR, please ask me before using them in your projects.** - You don't have to ask me if you're running a Polymer/PolyMC server, after all you need a resource pack to be able to see anything.

## Dependencies
Requires [NbtCrafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-crafting) mod

Comes bundled with Polymer, Server-Translations-API and sgui

## Changes
Not a lot of code was changed, most was kept in place as it seems to still work. After all, if it ain't broken then don't fix it :p 

Some parts of the code were cleaned up and some extra features were introduced.
- Seperate registry class for Backpacks and Items, tidied up EntryPoint (now DCDServback) and removed code which would be no longer needed, or maybe they were needed. Well, seems to work fine without em, somewhat.
- Polymer RP Utils for themed backpacks via resource pack so if your server uses resource pack then you can enjoy the new look of them
- Changed backpacks 

Cookie - 9 Slots (Common)

Truffle - 18 Slots (Common)

Pancake - 27 Slots (Uncommon)

Pierogi - 36 Slots (Rare)

Strawberry Pierogi - 45 Slots (Epic, Fireproof)

- A little bit more challenging backpack recipes (You'll have to become a farmer for this one)
- New advancements
- Server Side Translations API, you can modify the names and stuff if you feel inclined to do so in data\dcdservback\lang\en_us.json


I might've been hungry while editing this so if you see a lot of food references then that's probably why.

## PRs are always welcome
idk what i'm doing so some guidance is always good, also translations are welcome.
